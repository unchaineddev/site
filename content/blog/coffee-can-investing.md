**_'The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago; the second best time is now.'_**

I strongly beleive in the eight wonder of the world. It may be common sensical
for someone with good discipline, patience, and consistency that the secret
lies in waiting for the magic to unfold. The only way, my friend is paying the
price: _Time_  

This magical reminder comes in a form of a book: Coffee Can Investing by Saurab
Mukherjea and his team, that have created a roadmap that captures the common
pitfalls of a common retail investor. A guide to make wise financial decisions
without compromising on your wants and desires. 

I would highly recommend this book to someone who wants to filter out the noise
and focus on the goals. 

<u>Note:</u> It may not be necessary for everyone to read the entire book, yet
skimming through to understand the core philosophy should do the trick.
