I stumbled upon a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLy3YOJeogA)
featuring *Mr. Parakala Prabhakar*, interviewed by few of the last esteemed
journalists left in our country today: *Mr. Karan Thapar*. The discussion delved
into the current state of politics, economy and social fabric of our country.

Mr. *Parakala Prabhakar* is a political activist, *economist*, scholar, and
author. Parakala, if you are unaware, is also the husband of the current
Finance Minister, *Nirmala Sitharaman*. This adds an intriguing level to this
discussion. 

Parakala's unapologetic honesty and unwavering stance against the Modi Regime
is profoundly shocking, yet not entirely unprecedented. It was really
compelling to see a man speak truths in a world of men and women intolerant of
criticism in any shape or form. My decision to to pick his book, _"The Crooked
Timber Of New India"_ was with a desire for a deeper understanding of our
polity, economy and progress as a nation. 

In his book, he speaks in length of the failures of the Modi Government,
particularly the false promises to reduce unemployment, abolish corruption,
demonetization of currency notes that broke the backbone of our economy,
mishandling of COVID-19, amongst others. In a chapter, Parakala skillfully
employs the "Rabbit-duck illusion" as an analogy to depict the state of affairs
within the ruling party. I found it very clever and insightful.

Mishandling of COVID-19 by the Central Government is unforgettable. It is marked
in history, as they conveniently prioritized their crony capitalists over
public good. The illusionary schemes were merely for show, nothing helped
citizens. Poverty was at an all-time high since 1990s. 75 Million were pushed
to poverty, and the government did nothing but praise itself for "2.5 Cr Jabs".
Parakala shares one story of a young boy victim to the poverty of the New
India, and then shares a powerful quote by Gandhiji which made me feel hopeful
of a future leader that would bring about change like this --

**_"Whenever you are faced with a difficult situation, imagine the poorest of the
poor and see if your decision brings a smile to their faces."_**

Another fascinating chapter was: "Egocracy: Digital Freedom and Data Privacy".
Parakala deeply examines the rising internet shutdowns, concerning accumulation
of data from Big Tech Companies collected for government use, pervasive erosion
of privacy, content moderation, removing posts by targeting critics, and data
breaches. I was happy to read a well-researched and accurate account of the
state of privacy in India. It felt like a breath of fresh air to read this
essay, and I was glad to realize people like Parakala exist, to fight against
lost causes.

Speaking of lost causes, there is a lot of horrible attempts to rewrite and
portray history. The fear of an incompetant leader swaying masses through media
and his oracy, calling his reign as _The New India_, and what ever came before
him were all but an underwhelming effect says a lot about him. In addition, the
push for a singular national identity at the expense of democratic values is a
cause for deep concern.

There is lot of wistful politics at play, rather than focusing on pressing
issues. Obvious one is polarizing Hindu-Muslim dynamics, push for a singular
Hindu-Hindi identity for being hailed as truly Indian, population control of a
certain community by stoking fear about an imagined scenario of numerical
equality.

After reading this book, you feel a void in your heart. Something you cannot
fill, something you cannot mend. The state of affairs in India today as
portrayed by Parakala makes your blood boil. Sadly, this is a harsh reality we
as citizens have conformed to. Yet, amidst the despair, the solution is a call
to action. Between we _as a people_ against governments who divide us by caste,
creed or religion. Against media houses who spread propaganda and cannot stand
criticism of the government. It is also a battle against the people amongst us
who undermine democracy and stay hidden behind an idelogy.
