It is not your typical underdog story where the protagonist goes from poverty to prosperity. 12th fail is an inspiring take on hope, determination, honesty and failure. Contrary to many other bollywood biographies, lack of a traditional villain in this story is a bold move. This made it all the more intriguing. 

Moreover VVC captures the universal struggle of truth and empathy, creating a narrative that resonates deeply with the audience and effortlessly brings tears to the surface.

Vikrant Massey's performance in this film is nothing short of extraordinary. His role as _Manoj_ is deserving of a National Award. The supporting cast were equally remarkable in their roles that contributed to the film's excellence. What stood out to me most was the beautiful score composed by Shantanu Moitra, which served as the soulful essence of the film. It added more depth to the narrative and made it a good cinematic experience.

In its entirety, '12th Fail' emerges as a thought-provoking masterpiece. Beyond mere entertainment, it is inspiring. It is one of those films that one can revisit for a much-needed restart during moments of demotivation.
