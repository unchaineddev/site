Looking back at 2023, it makes me realize how quickly time slips through our fingers. It was a wonderful (yet hectic) year for me. I discovered wealth of information and shared eventful experiences with people. 
As I stand at the threshold of this new year, I anticipate more promising events and learnings.

I dislike making new year resolutions due to the psychological inclination of undertaking drastic changes, so I have committed myself to implement small changes for a lasting impact, some of which are follows:

#### üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Physical Health üèäüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Last year, I covered several kilometers on foot, including my daily walk to work. I spent hours on this activity, although I feel a 20 minute jog this year would be more effective. In addition, I went swimming for a couple of months during the weekends, and I intend on resuming it come summer. Along with this, I wish to induldge in intense physical activities which I would enjoy once a week and improve my sleep quality.

#### ü•¨ Diet ü•¨

In October, I faced a severe illness that made me realize how invaluable good health is. Thus, I made a conscious decision to cut down junk food (especially sugar) from my life.
I don't have a sweet spot for sugary foods anyway, so it worked out well for me. I will continue to avoid sugary foods, except on special occasions, and have junk-food once a month. I have also adopted the habit of having an early dinner and plan to maintain this practice. *Drink More Water than Coffee.*


#### Learning & Self-Improvement üß†

-- *__Reading__* 

2023 was a busy year for me, which left little room for leisurely reading. this year I intend to spend more time reading on diverse topics. I read a couple non-fiction novels, and I would be happy to read more non-fiction this year, along with other people's code/poetry/stories.


-- *__Programming__ & __Tech__* 

Python was my go-to language and shall remain so this year. I am sure to get my hands dirty with js and I aim to learn a little bit of Rust too. ü¶Ä
for the longest time I wanted to learn a NoSQL Db such as Mongo, so I am hoping to integrate one project with it. 

at last, I want to self-host a few tools I use and understand Web3 tech. All in all, stay updated with the industry trends.


-- *__Other Stuff__* 

- Learn trading and understand the technical aspects. 

- Track and reduce unnecessary expenses and use the money to take up a new hobby and travel to a new place instead.

- Watch good films, and avoid crappy films as such. Old cinema preferred. duh!

- Discover solutions to enhance file management while restructuring repositories on my Github/Gitlab.

- Contribute to a few open-source projects.



-- *__Writing__*

- Write anything and everything. Blog often as a priority. 

- Simplify complex problems. solve atleast one problem on leetcode.
