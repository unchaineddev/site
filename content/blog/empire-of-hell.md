All the world's a digital stage, \
and all the men and women merely scrollin' -- \
with no exits, their entrance is a screen -- \
a portal to their unseen dreams. broken\
and broke. impulse and hope-less.

a double-edged sword. swallow whole\
pleasure and pain. one man at their time\
plays many parts of ruin.

His acts being seven gigs of your intimate data.\
first phase of his playbook -- lure you in.\
Then gather and sell, finally build networth\
and tell the world, "I created an empire of hell."
