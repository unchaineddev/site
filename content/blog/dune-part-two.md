<b>SILENCE. </b> \*  _**The Lisan al Gaib speaks**_  \*  

There is so much to say about Dune: a sci-fi marvel that exceeds
expectations. On my first viewing of Dune Part One, it lacked the _spice_. But
months later after revisiting the film, I found myself pleasantly surprised by
the depth of the story. This led me to watch Dune: Part Two on the big
screen.

And oh boy, Timothee has dune it again. I beleive he is one of the few actors
in Hollywood that can pull off diverse roles like these. The transition from
Wonka to Paul Atreides showcases his exceptional talent. Austin Butler's
performance as creepy bald Feyd deserves an applause, while Zendaya, Javier
Bardem and Rebecca Fergusson further elevate the film with their compelling
performances.

For the majority of Dune: Part Two, Paul Atreides a.k.a _Muad'dib Usul_ has no
interest in being a messiah figure and wanted to just help the people of Fremen
take control of what is rightfully theirs: _Arrakis_. Chani valued him for
this, but not for long. It was a disappointing blow after he officially
declared himself as _"The Madhi"_, after drinking the Water Of Life. The way
the plot has turned out, it is really fascinating to await the forthcoming
development in these characters.


Denis Villeneuve's vision with the cinematic brilliance of Greig Fraser, makes
way for rich dialogue (Jon Spaihts) and breathtaking cinematography. Do not
miss this film.

**"May thy knife chip and shatter."**
