Bengaluru is like a dear friend who gets along really well with anyone. She's
known for her pleasant nature, creative mind, love for greens and hanging out
with people of diverse backgrounds. As someone who has lived with Bengaluru,
like many of us, who deeply value the essence of her character, I would reject
the idea if someone told me our beloved city could a face water crisis or reach
a scorching high temperature of 37 degrees this summer. (again)

After all, we love her as we have seen her -- Grow as a quaint garden city to a
beautiful bustling metropolis. A city crowded by cars and cafes, ignoring the
effects of climate change and urbanization. And now our dear friend is weary. While
her heart beats with a passion for technology and innovation, she longs for a
break from endless development. 

To ensure her sustainability for years to come, let us recognize her need to
prioritize self-care. Here are a few simple things you can do to nurture your 
friendsip with Bengaluru.

1. Conserve water by fixing leaks, taking shorter showers, turning off taps when not in use, and using water wisely.
2. Turn off lights, fans, and electronic devices when not in use to conserve energy and lower utility bills.
3. Advocate for increased tree planting initiatives, and protest against cutting down trees for corporate profit.
4. Practice proper waste management by segregating waste at the source into recyclables and non-recyclables.
5. Opt for public transport whenever possible to alleviate carbon emissions and traffic congestion.
6. Spread awareness about environmental issues and the importance of sustainability through social media and other mediums.
