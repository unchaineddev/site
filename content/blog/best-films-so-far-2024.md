Finding a standout film, especially in the first half of the year, has been
quite a challenge. Thankfully, there were a few gems that truly captivated me.


My top pick is a sci-fi marvel: [Dune](/blog/dune-part-two/). To miss Dune is
like denying oneself peak cinema. Followin closely is Guadagninoâ€™s
*Challengers*. Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross' beautiful score, paired with the
impeccable fashion choices by the leads sets the standard for ultimate fashion
goals.


A24 continues to deliver intriguing films. Civil War presents a compelling
dystopian narrative that captivated me, while Love Lies Bleeding unfolds as a
powerful drama with standout moments. Amongst other English films, Monkey Man and
The Idea of You were unexpectedly good enough.


Reflecting on Bollywood, disappointments are not new with the remakes, although
Shaitaan stood out. Bhumi shines in Bhakshak, Merry Christmas was a good
attempt and Imtiaz Ali's Amar Singh Chamkila left a lasting impression. Next on
my list is Lapata Ladies.


Malayalam Cinema though, is currently at its peak. *Manjummel Boys* was
thrilling and gained widespread popularity, while Fafa's swag in *Aavesham*
worked its magic. *Anweshippin Kandethum* also held its own with a commendable
performance.
