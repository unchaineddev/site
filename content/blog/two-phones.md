When I was starting out as a working professional two years ago, I made a
pivotal decision that would redefine the way I interact with technologies. As a
privacy advocate and free software enthusiast, my aim was to reduce my reliance
on Google Services and other non-free software. This decision propelled me to
carry two phones to compartmentalize my online activity.


My primary phone is a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8, running LineageOS 18.1 and Android
11 (without Google Services). My work/non-free software running phone is a
Samsung M12 running Google Android 13 with OneUI version 5.1.

I bought Redmi a couple of months before covid-19. I loved how it boasted an
impressive camera, long-lasting battery, in-fact it checked every box in
the features department. The catch-22 was the intrusive personalized
advertising and the burden of pre-installed bloatware on the device.


For obvious reasons, I switched to LineageOS because it offered a clean user
experience, particularly enjoying its UI. Additionally, it provided regular
security patches, a feature often lacking in the original MIUI. To this day, I
still receive security patches in lineageOS which is just awesome. The
trade-off sadly was a borked camera. * which I kind of got accustomed too :( 


On the other hand, I relied on my Samsung Google Android device, particularly
for financial transactions via UPI, using proprietary spyware like WhatsApp to
be a part of pointless groups, order food through Zomato/Swiggy, book Uber, or
engage in work activities such as checking mail.


Amidst all of this, I was consciously using free and open source applications
(whenever possible) across both my devices. Some of them include:


- F-Droid
- Brave Browser
- KDE Connect
- Mozilla Firefox (or any fork of it)
- Signal Messenger 
- A few Simple Mobile Tools applications - Contacts, Gallery, Dialer. ( do not
  use it anymore since the apps are not open-source)
- VLC Media Player
- Telegram FOSS (fork) 


Having two phones offer some other advantages which I can appreciate. Firstly,
I won't have to worry about battery life. With two devices, I can distribute my
usage, lessening the strain on each battery. This ensures I always have a backup
available in case one device runs out of power. Also since I'm not particularly
fond of power banks, this setup suited me perfectly. 


I also prefer keeping my data locally rather than storing it in the cloud. So I
transitioned to storing all my media, documents, and important files on a hard
drive, with backups stored on my devices. This approach ensures my data is
easily accessible, under control and compartmentalized. This was perfect for
my threat modeling, however it does come at a cost of inconvenience. Carrying
two phones isn't particularly comfortable, but it's a compromise I'm willing to
make. 


So yeah, I am glad to have made this decision, and I am grateful for the community
of developers and contributors who have built foss projects and made them
publicly available for free.


_Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer'._
