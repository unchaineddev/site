All the big news organizations are known for manipulating facts and having biased opinions. If you think there are not taking a side, you are overly optimistic. Moreover, relying on a for-profit major news organizations is akin to burying one's head in the sand and trusting whatever information comes along. 
It is a no-brainer. Their support for Israel makes it even more clear of their ignorance. More civilians are killed by Israel and they will never show you that. 

*An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind*. They will never tell you _Hamas_ is __NOT__ _Palestine._ 

In addition to news organizations, there are a certain "smart" people which I have found myself losing a lot of respect for. Despite their extensive knowledge in their respective fields, it's disheartening to see they do not see the bigger picture and prioritize personal interests over basic human rights. 

Their unwavering support for Israel is crystal clear that they cannot be trusted. It is disturbing to see their indifference towards the consequences of Israeli actions on Palestinian civilians, especially considering that over half of the population comprises children.


Generally I oppose the use of social media, however in a time like this, people who actively use it must not remain silent on such matters, considering how swiftly people post about trending topics. It's crucial to recognize that silence can inadvertently contribute to the perpetuation of hatred.
If it does not happen to you, that doesn't mean you need to turn a blink eye, and that is the message of this blog.

- Albert Einstein on Palestine: [^2]
        
    “I am in favor of Palestine being developed as a Jewish Homeland but not as a separate state. 
    It seems to me a matter of simple common sense that we cannot ask to be given political rule over Palestine where two thirds of the population are not Jewish.”

- Many Jews (except the Zionists)[^3] are still of the opinion to _free Palestine_ and to live in _peace_ with each other.[^4]
