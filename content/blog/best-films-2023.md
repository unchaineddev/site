these are my favorite films of 2023. of course, there are better films i have missed. do let me know if any.

## English/Foreign

- [Barbenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbenheimer)

Two films that are a phenomenon in itself - Greta Gerwig's hysterical comedy and Nolan's Atomic Bomb. My favorites this year.


- [Killers Of The Flower Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_(film))

An epic about Osage killings. Killers Of The Flower Moon is a good Western with fine storytelling; the kind you expect from a Scorcese film.

- [Past Lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_Lives_(film))

Past lives takes a very nuanced approach to the what-ifs. it is praiseworthy for its spectacular dialogue and emotional story.


- [The Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killer_(2023_film))

Michael Fassbender, "the Killer" assassin on a killing spree after a hit goes wrong. Yikes, truly worth a watch!  


- [Are you there God? It's me, Margaret.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_There_God%3F_It%27s_Me,_Margaret._(film))

A coming-of-age drama which I did not expect I would like. It's a simple story of a young girl and the challenges she faces in her adolescence.


- [Suzume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzume)

A beautiful world of Shinkai through a fantastical adventure of Suzume, helping a mysterious man close doors that is causing disasters in Japan.


- [A Haunting in Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Haunting_in_Venice)

Yet another Poirot story you just cannot get enough of.


- [Anatomy Of A Fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy_of_a_Fall)

A courtroom drama about a writer trying to prove her innocence in her husband's death.


- [Blackberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_(film))

honestly after watching this film, it just makes you want to turn back time.. and own a _blackberry_.


- [Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%E2%80%93_Dead_Reckoning_Part_One)

Imagine an omnipotent A.I taking over the world? Well, this movie could potentially be the trailer of what's to happen irl.


- [Knock At the Cabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knock_at_the_Cabin)

Knock, Knock, who's there? A prophecy, delivered by four individuals who claim the fate of the world hinges on sacrificing a family member. 


### Indian films 

-- *This year was the year of commercial cinema*


- [12th Fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_Fail)

An extraordinary take on the real-life story of Manoj Kumar Sharma, who overcame extreme poverty to become an Indian Police Service officer. It's my favorite Indian film this year.

- [Sirf Ek Banda Kaafi Hai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirf_Ek_Bandaa_Kaafi_Hai)

Another courtroom drama I liked with a delicate subject starring Bajpayee, who time and again proves, *ki ek acchi film ke liye sirf ek banda kaafi hai.*


- [Pathaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathaan_(film)) & [Jawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawan_(film))

Let's just say Pathaan is an event film, while Jawan is a longing for Shah Rukh Khan to be back on screen again. Purely commercial entertainers!


- [Animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_(2023_film))

Is the hype real? Well, from a technical standpoint it is good, it is bold & unlike any other Indian film you will see. 

- [Maamannan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maamannan)

A politically charged drama with beautiful imagery and unique metaphors.


- [Jailer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailer_(2023_Tamil_film)) & [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(2023_Indian_film))

Big commercial stars with over-the-top action set-pieces. 

- [Ponniyin Selvan - Part II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponniyin_Selvan:_II)

PS-2 fares well in terms of filmmaking in comparsion to the first part.


- [2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_(film)) & [Kannur Squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannur_Squad)

Both stories have a common theme of taking charge as a leader, working with a team and driven by human emotions.
