Signal is a great messaging app for private digital communications. Features like end-to-end encryption, 
privacy and security is time-tested.  

With the introduction to usernames, exposure to phone numbers is minimal. It is a great feature 
to have when you do not want to share your number with someone for a chat. The phone number is used 
for sign up, however it will no longer be visible to everyone on Signal.

This is wonderful news for privacy and security enthusiasts, journalists, whistleblowers, and a big win
for digital freedom.
