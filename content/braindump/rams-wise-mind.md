Though Ram is troublesome and mischievous in the eyes of many, he is not to Narayani. She assumes the role of a mother-figure to him, adding a layer of complexity and tenderness to their relationship.

Chattopadhyay's storytelling shines as he paints a vivid picture of the emotional landscape between Ram and Narayani. Their bond becomes a testament to the enduring power of human connection, defying societal norms and expectations.

For those seeking a literary experience that elegantly captures the intricacies of human emotion, this short story is a compelling choice.
