Last weekend I attended the Zero1 Fest -- the worldâ€™s first festival around
finance and money. It was exhilarating to be in the presence of people whose
content I deeply admire; whose profound knowledge especially in finance has
influenced and "de-influenced" me.  

I had the opportunity to see the Kamath brothers up close, whose startup serves
as a powerful reminder that a business can thrive without backing of venture
capital. I had a chat with Karthik Rangappa, curator of Varsity and expressed
deep appreciation for his captivating content. I was nostalgic to see Rob from
"M.A.D" fame, whose show was a beloved staple for 90s and early 2000s kids. I
had a brief moment with Prateek Singh, Founder & CEO of LearnApp and Zero1
Media, whose talk with Radhika Gupta (Edelweiss CEO) left a lasting impression.
Although I missed out on meeting many other familiar faces like Abid Hassan,
Rahul Subramanian, Nas, among others, I still had a wonderful time!
